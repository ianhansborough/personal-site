I was introduced to this project through one of Hatchli’s mentors who runs New Coast Ventures, a boutique venture capital firm in Chicago. I was brought on as a front-end engineer joined a team of about 50 other AOL software engineers and/or other private contractors. I took part in a two month sprint that entailed completely rebuilding AOL’s internal portal for ad network management.

This project provided me with some excellent exposure to Angular 1.5x, and it was my first time working with an “enterprise sized” team. Needless to say, working with a team that large is a completely different than the small, nimble startup / freelance teams I was used to working with. Despite the usual challenges with coordinating a group of engineers of that size, we managed to finish the build on time; apparently quite a feat in the world of enterprise software.

Unfortunately, I don't have any good screenshots for this project, as it software built for AOL's internal use only. If you'd like to know more about the project, I'd be happy to speak to it further!
