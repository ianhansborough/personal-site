Wallace Hatch has been, and continues to be, an awesomely entertaining side-hustle. I launched this back in February along with a couple of guys that I used to work with at Vest. Based in our home town of Columbus, Wallace Hatch is a direct-to-consumer digitally native watch company that specializes in minimalist watches at a minimal price point.

The site's frontend is a Vue.js web app with SSR implemented using Nuxtjs. The API is written in Go using mux for all http request routing and dispatching. This build for this site also included 3rd party integrations with Stripe, Easypost, and Instagram.

Aside from building out the website and e-commerce side of things, Wallace Hatch has afforded me the opportunity to work with some amazingly creative people. The photographers, stylists, models, and designers that have helped build the Wallace Hatch brand have given me a glimpse into the world of retail and brand building. I still have a lot to learn in this space, but weâ€™re having a great time with it so far!
