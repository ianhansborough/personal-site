A truly crazy experience. Vest is a financial technology startup based in Manhattan. When I was brought on as a member of the team, the company had just raised a 7-figure seed round. They had a surplus of capital, but an absolute dearth of marketable product.

As the chief product officer in a sub-10 employee company, I had my hands in just about everything. I was regularly jumping between frontend development, managing contractors, technical hiring, digital marketing, and doing product demos with the CEO.

My technical contributions during my time at Vest were focused around building out a suite of web-based financial wellness tools. The frontend of this toolkit was built as a classic SPA using Vue.js along with Vuex (a Vue.js implementation of the Flux architecture) for application state management. The backend consisted of a GraphQL server implemented using Go and persisted using MongoDB. This build featured a 3rd party integration with Plaid (a transaction aggregator) that allowed us to pull transaction data for a user in real time and classify recurring and/or abnormal transactions. These classifiers were written using Python.
