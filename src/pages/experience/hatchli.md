My first startup adventure. Hatchli was an idea born from our run-down college house at Ohio State. Originally, we thought it would be super interesting to apply the “tinder concept” to ideas instead of people. This quickly evolved into a full-blown online platform for creators to come together and validate early-stage ideas.

After receiving investment from [The Brandery](https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2016/07/18/brandery-names-2016-startup-class.html), a nationally-ranked accelerator, the team and I packed our lives up, put school on hold, and moved down to Cincinnati to pursue our vision for what Hatchli could be.

On the tech side, Hatchli consisted of a responsive web application and an iOS application for consumers, as well as a corporate platform for large companies to use internally. The consumer web application was built using python Django on the backend, PostgreSQL as the database, and HTML/CSS and jQuery on the frontend. The iOS application utilized the same Django API as the web-app, and was built in Swift.

I served as the CEO at Hatchli. In the early days I was heavily involved in the development of the iOS application. As the company grew, more of my time was spent “[doing CEO things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8DPeNcc15c)” i.e campaigning for investment and courting potential customers.

In the end, it was a lack of a solid monetization strategy that killed Hatchli. We made the decision to officially shut down the platform in early 2017. Regardless of the outcome, Hatchli was a life changing experience for me. I learned a great deal from the experience, and I hope to someday apply that knowledge towards building something game-changing.
